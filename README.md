# Georgianne & Ramon Raspberry Pi Pico Puzzle

Hello Friends!

This is a quick puzzle i put together for you all for supporting me and my spouse in our matrimony.

Thank you again for everything you did for us!

you all revieved a **raspberry pi pico w**

the raspberry pi is already mostly setup, just plug it into your computer to power it on and follow [some parts of this guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/get-started-pico-w/) to upload your wifi credentials to the device so that it can connect to your WiFi.

you'll want to [install Thony](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/get-started-pico-w/0), a micropython IDE for microcontrollers

And then [use it](https://www.freva.com/transfer-files-between-computer-and-raspberry-pi-pico/) to read, edit, and re-upload the **wifi.json** file in your Raspberry pi pico w.

from there you can restart the raspberry pi pico by unplugging and replugging it into your PC for power.
or soft rebooting it with ctrl-d

now just find it on your network and connect to it from your browser  for more details and to get started.
