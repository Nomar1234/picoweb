        <h1>Georgianne & Ramon 2023</h1>
        <h2>Hello Friends!</h2>
        <p>This is a quick puzzle I put together for you as a gift for supporting me and Georgianne in our matrimony.</p>
        <p>Thank you again for everything you did for us!</p>
        <h2>Puzzle</h2>
        <P>I've generated an ETH secret key for each of you.</P>
        <p>the puzzle is to guess the secret key.</p>
        <p>Once you've figured out what your secret key is, you can check on <a href="https://etherscan.io">etherscan</a> or <a href="https://polygonscan.com/">polygonscan</a> to see if there is any ETH or MATIC or maybe even an NFT all yours for the taking.</p>
        <h2>GL;HF</h2>
        <p>good luck password cracking! don't worry there are hints below!</p>

        <h3>hint: 1</h3>
        <p>the first 9 words of your secret key are the following. but they are in random order, so you'll have to find the right order</p>
        <!-- PASTE FIRST 9 WORDS HERE -->
        <p><b>PASTE-HERE</b></p>

        <h3>hint: 2</h3>
        <p>your secret key is made up of 12 of 2048 possible words</p>
        <p>those words can be found <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/eth-account/blob/master/eth_account/hdaccount/wordlist/english.txt">here at the Ethereum GitHub</a></p>
